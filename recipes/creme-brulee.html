    <h1>Creme Brulee</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creme brulee, also known as burnt cream or Trinity cream, and virtually identical to the original crema catalana, is a dessert consisting of a rich custard base topped with a layer of hardened caramelized sugar.</p>
    <p>It is normally served slightly chilled; the heat from the caramelizing process tends to warm the top of the custard, while leaving the center cool. The custard base is traditionally flavored with vanilla in French cuisine, but can have other flavorings. It is sometimes garnished with fruit.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (150g) granulated sugar, divided</li>
            <li>3 cups (720ml) heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325°F (163°C).</li>
            <li>Whisk the egg yolks and 1/2 cup (100g) of granulated sugar together. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the heavy cream and salt together in a medium saucepan over medium heat. As soon as it begins to simmer, remove from heat. Stir in the vanilla extract. Remove about 1/2 cup of warm heavy cream and, in a slow and steady stream, whisk into the egg yolks. Keep those egg yolks moving so they don’t scramble. In a slow and steady stream, pour and whisk the egg yolk mixture into the warm heavy cream.</li>
            <li>Place ramekins in a large baking pan. If you don’t have 1 pan large enough, bake them in a couple pans. Divide custard between each ramekin, filling to the top. Carefully fill the pan with about a 1/2 inch of the hot water. The baking pan will be hot so use an oven mitt to carefully transfer the pan to the oven.</li>
            <li>Bake until the edges are set and centers are a little jiggly. The time depends on the depth of your ramekins. My ramekins are 1-inch and the custard takes 35 minutes. Begin checking them at 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove pan from the oven and, using an oven mitt, remove the ramekins from the pan. Place on a wire rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Place in the refrigerator, loosely covered, and chill for at least 4 hours and up to 2 days before topping.</li>
            <li>Using the remaining granulated sugar, sprinkle a thin layer all over the surface of the chilled custards. Caramelize the sugar with a kitchen torch and serve immediately or store in the refrigerator for up to 1 hour before serving.</li>
        </ol>

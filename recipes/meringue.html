    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Meringue is a type of dessert or candy, often associated with Swiss, French, Polish and Italian cuisines, traditionally made from whipped egg whites and sugar, and occasionally an acidic ingredient such as lemon, vinegar, or cream of tartar. A binding agent such as salt, flour or gelatin may also be added to the eggs.</p>
    <p>The key to the formation of a good meringue is the formation of stiff peaks by denaturing the protein ovalbumin (a protein in the egg whites) via mechanical shear. Its flavorants are vanilla, a small amount of apple juice, or orange juice, although if extracts of these are used and are based on an oil infusion, an excess of fat from the oil may inhibit the egg whites from forming a foam.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large egg whites</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Remove eggs from the refrigerator and separate, as they will separate best cold.</li>
            <li>Allow egg whites to reach room temperature to allow them to whip to their fullest.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>Pour eggs whites into a spotlessly-clean bowl.</li>
            <li>Whip the egg whites until they are glossy and smooth, then add the cream of tartar to help the egg whites hold their form.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the sugar to the egg whites about a tablespoon at a time, beating after each addition until the sugar is incorporated. Continue beating until stiff peaks form. </li>
            <li>Spread meringue on top of pre-baked or no-bake dessert, place about 4 inches under the heat and bake for about 10 minutes, until golden.</li>
        </ol>
